# DevOps Current Task: Phase 0x11 Support

**Role**: DevOps Engineer
**Status**: Standby / Monitoring

## 🎯 Current Focus: Funding Module Infrastructure

### 1. Database
*   **Action**: Monitor migrations for `0x11_deposit_withdraw`.
*   **Verification**: Ensure `deposit_history` is created safely without locking production (when we deploy).

### 2. Mock Chain Environment
*   **Requirement**: No external containers needed for MVP (it's In-Memory/Struct based).
*   **Future**: Prepare for "Real Node" integration (Phase 0x12).
